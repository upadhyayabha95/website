      <h3>Distortion Aversion Watermarking System</h3>
      <p> A CNN based watermarking system that can be used to extract inherent features from picture by training the CNN model. And when
 training to CNN model is done then inherent feature is obtained and permutated with owner’s watermark pattern to create master share.
 And in picture verification part, the picture goes under pre-trained CNN to get its inherent feature back. And also apply DWT to image for
 watermarking purpose to check the effectiveness of CNN model. And to ensure the robustness of proposed technique, DWT based
 watermarking method is get also evaluated and make sure that CNN based watermarking technique provide better results in terms of
 robustness and maintain the integrity.</p>

      <h3>Secure Doctor-Patient Portal</h3>
      <p>Entire project is a combination of two separate projects which are used to support each other. Doctor-Patient Portal-The Doctor Patient
 Portal being the primary project is an Enterprise Resource Management System made by using PHP and HTML as for its major end. For
 database management, we've went for MySQL as a means to store the databases. The main concern of making this Portal is to provide an
 ERP System for hospitals. The second part of the project was a Secure File Transfer System which will be used to send and receive files
 across internet and/or ethernet systems securely. The purpose of this file. The Secure File Transfer System is embedded into the Doctor
 Patient Portal to make the storing of client’s data and doctor's details confidential, and also in-turn verify the integrity of the data. Also,
 there will be a Client- side software for the purpose of data encryptions (which will stay at the user's local drive) and shall be used to
 encrypt and send data across any network.</p>
